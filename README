This is just a baseline skeleton that can be used to create a Google AppEngine GAE application.

STEPS TO GET STARTED:
1) Fill out app.yaml by entering in your application name in place of (TESTAPP)

Done!

Some features include:

1) ability to use sessions via gaesessions
	you can do things like:
	
		session = get_current_session()
		session_var = 'bleh'
		session[session_var] = 1

	and you can also do stuff like:

		def checkAccess(session_var):
			session = get_current_session()
			try:
				if (session[session_var] == 1):
				return 1
			else:
				return 0
		except KeyError:
			return 0
		return 1
		
2) ability to use a cdn (another GAE instance or any other CDN).  default is to not use a CDN.
	set up the CDN_HOST (as well as other properties file type stuff) in the settings.py file
	
3) Data model is separated out into models.py.  I have a couple of sample tables in there for reference.

4) use of django html templates in a separate "templates" folder.  "home" is the main folder.  "sub1" - "sub3" are samples of more subdirectories if you want them.

5) use of django base html templates for headers, footers, etc.

If this helps you get started, then great!  If you have something better, let me know.  I know that this is very rudimentary.
